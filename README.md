Project Description:

This project performs object detection in videos by matching a template image to frames in the video. It identifies the presence of an object in real-time and provides feedback on successful detection.

The Problem Statement:

Analyzing video feeds to identify specific objects can be tedious and time-consuming when done manually.

The Solution:

We simplify object detection by allowing users to upload a template image and video. The system uses template matching to locate the object in the video. A user-friendly GUI ensures an engaging and straightforward experience for everyone.

Technical Details:

Technologies/Components Used

For Software:

Languages Used: Python

Frameworks Used: Tkinter (for GUI)

Libraries Used: OpenCV (for image and video processing)

Tools Used: Python runtime, File dialog for input

Implementation

For Software:

Installation:

Install Python (version 3.7 or later).

Install required libraries using pip: pip install opencv-python-headless

Run:

Save the code to a file, e.g., object_detection_gui.py.

Run the script: python object_detection_gui.py

Use the GUI to upload a template image and video, then click "Start Detection" to begin.
